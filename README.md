# 19CSE456 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning (NNDL)

This repository is for practicing neural networks as part of the 19CSE456 course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning (NNDL). The course provides an introduction to deep neural network models and surveys some of the applications of these models in areas where they have been particularly successful.

## Course Overview

The course covers:
- Feedforward Networks
- Convolutional Networks
- Recurrent and Recursive Networks
- Input Encoding
- Training Techniques


## Repository Structure
<!-- 

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for various neural network models and experiments.
- **Datasets**: Contains sample datasets used in the notebooks.
- **Models**: Contains trained models and architectures.
-->
- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
<!-- 
- Python 3.8 or higher
